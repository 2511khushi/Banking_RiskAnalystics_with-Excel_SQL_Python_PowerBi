# OrbitBank: Risk Metrics & Insights

## Overview
This project dives into the realm of banking and financial services by developing a Power BI dashboard to analyze risk in lending operations. Leveraging datasets on client profiles, this project employs Power BI, SQL, Python, and Excel to uncover insights into loan repayment likelihood, customer engagement, and financial metrics. The dashboard aids in minimizing financial risk by informing data-driven lending decisions and provides a foundation for understanding banking dynamics.


### Tech Stack
- **Excel**: Data validation and preliminary exploration.
- **SQL**: Data querying, joining, and transformation.
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn): Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.
- **Power BI**: Interactive visualizations.


## Dataset
The dataset comprises multiple tables linked via primary and foreign keys, including:
- `banking_clients.csv`: Client demographics, financial details, and account information.
- `banking_relationships.csv`: Information on client relationships with the bank.
- `clients_gender.csv`: Gender classification for clients.
- `investment_advisors.csv`: Details on associated investment advisors.

### Task List
- Explored and validated `.csv` files for data integrity using Excel.
- Queried and joined tables (e.g., Clients, Banking Relationships) using SQL for unified analysis.
- Performed EDA and engineered features like Engagement Days, Income Bands and Processing Fees in Python.
- Built interactive dashboards with filters (e.g., Banking Relationship, Gender, Joining Year) using Power BI.

## Outcome
The final Power BI dashboard provides deep visibility into key risk metrics and client behavior, supporting strategic decisions around loan approvals. It empowers banks to:
- Assess loan repayment risks using client and financial metrics.
- Analyze deposit and loan trends by occupation, nationality, and income band.
- Make data-driven lending decisions with interactive visualizations.
